For new petitions:
	- Scrape which petitions are new.
	- For each petition:
		- Make an entry in PETITIONS.
		- Check if user is new.
			- If yes, make entry in PETITIONERS.
				- Get previous petitions.
			- If no, do nothing, since we can extrapolate new
			  petitions from PETITIONS.
		- Make an entry in SIGNATURES
