    "overview": "<p>We Paid in Blood, Sweat and Tears.\u00a0 Sorry for the graphic photo, but this is one of my\u00a0buddy's body armor who was wounded in Afghanistan.\u00a0 He fortunately survived, but\u00a0this\u00a0is just one of the many sacrifices we\u00a0made to honor our\u00a0end\u00a0of the contracts.</p>\n<p>The CA Army National Guard offered bonuses to soldiers who had specifically needed job skills, and\u00a0were willing to sign up for 3-or 6 -year enlistments from 2006 to 2010. After\u00a017,000 soldiers signed the contracts, and in most cases completed the 6-year enlistments, many of which included combat tours, the National Guard sent letters to the soldiers stating they have to pay back the bonuses. The Army National Guard admittedly lacked manpower and oversight of their program and personnel in charge of the program.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Apparently,\u00a0they discovered\u00a0several cases of suspected fraud. Mostly the recruiters, who received incentives for recruiting soldiers. They convicted the NCO in charge of the program while higher ranking officers dodged punishment.\u00a0 In\u00a0one of her\u00a0defenses, she stated she was ordered to keep the personnel numbers up.\u00a0 In the meantime they did an audit and discovered minor mistakes in nearly 17,000 contracts and suggested they\u00a0were all\u00a0written in violation of Federal law.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rather than investigate each contract and making a decision as to whether or not there was criminal intent with each one, they simply decided they don't have to honor any of them. As for the soldiers, including myself, we signed the contracts in good faith, believing they were legitimate.\u00a0 Those long term contracts pretty much insured we would be deployed to combat.\u00a0 The purpose of the incentive program was to maintain their numbers so they could deploy troops to Afghanistan and Iraq.\u00a0 They got what they wanted, then once the war in Iraq ended they are\u00a0taking back the funds.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly,\u00a0since the rise of ISIS, they are offering a bonus\u00a0to\u00a0soldiers with specifically needed Job Skills, once again.\u00a0 We detrimentally relied on those contracts when we deployed.\u00a0 Several of my friends and I were involved in one of the most dangerous missions of our lives during that contract.\u00a0 I was knocked unconscious at one point when a roadside bomb struck my vehicle.\u00a0 Many of my friends were wounded during the conflict and some received purple hearts.\u00a0 I am still being\u00a0treated\u00a0 for\u00a0my\u00a0injuries 10 years later.\u00a0 If it were not for the bravery of those serving on my left and right, I don't know that any of us would have made it home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like many other soldiers, I honorably completed my contract in 2012 and two years later they sent me a letter stating I had to pay the money back.\u00a0 Each contract has a different\u00a0excuse. They stated the reason I was not eligible for the contract was because I had over 20 years of service at the time.\u00a0 I had originally signed up more than 20 years prior, but had breaks in service and only had 15 credible years of service, not 20.\u00a0 Although at the time, they informed me I was eligible for a bonus, now they are saying I was not.\u00a0 This is the justification they are using\u00a0for not honoring the contract 10 years later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0have a legally binding contract promising me the money in return for 6 years of service and I did my part.\u00a0 They can't give me my time back.\u00a0 Time I could have used in a better paying career.\u00a0 They can't erase the things I have done or seen, or erase my injuries. \u00a0How can they just take the money back without a judgment and without my permission?</p>\n<p>This should scare every American.\u00a0With regard to the statute of limitations, they stated there was a code in the Food Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, better known as (The Farm Bill)\u00a0that allows them to collect all debts, including those previously ineligible for collection, without limitation.\u00a0 Can the IRS also use this excuse to do tax audits from the day we first started paying taxes and charge us penalties? To add insult\u00a0to injury, I\u00a0received a $15,000 bonus for a 6-year term.\u00a0 They pre-taxed the bonus only paying me approximately $11,000 after the tax was taken out.\u00a0 But are now saying I have to pay the entire $15,000 back plus interest.\u00a0They are demanding I pay them the $4,000\u00a0all ready paid to the IRS.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After 90 days they\u00a0turned my debt over to the\u00a0Department of the Treasury, who fined me a\u00a028% penalty, including a penalty on the $4,000 paid to the IRS.\u00a0 So\u00a0now I owe the government almost\u00a0$20,000, when they were the ones who wrote the contract that they state is not valid.\u00a0 I'm being fined and penalized for\u00a0their incompetence and lack of oversight and the Treasury Department is now trying garnishing my civilian wages.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The National Guard\u00a0did create an over burdensome, procedural obstacle course, that requires soldiers to admit they received an erroneous payment, then\u00a0beg the CA National Guard to forgive them for receiving said payment.\u00a0\u00a0It takes a year and a half or longer just to see if we will be forgiven as if we did something wrong. The procedure takes so long because they continue to lack the manpower to review the paperwork they make us fill out, however in the\u00a0meantime, they have a large enough task force to\u00a0continue\u00a0garnishing soldiers wages against their will, without a court order, report unpaid debt, to credit bureaus, and collect from\u00a0soldier's tax returns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One of my fellow soldiers was on another deployment when he received his collection letter, and while he should have been focusing on the battlefield, he had to worry about his family's well being back home, because they garnished his entire paycheck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0transferred out of the National Guard in order to avoid their illegal wage garnishments, however,\u00a0they made it very clear, they will take it from\u00a0my tax returns.\u00a0 I\u00a0have heard, that there were at least three soldiers who were killed in Afghanistan,\u00a0and one committed suicide and their\u00a0spouses received\u00a0collection letters.\u00a0 This sickens me beyond belief. Now that I\u00a0was out of the military and struggling to provide for my wife and two babies, they are demanded I pay them almost $500 a month.\u00a0 They have quite literally ruined my life, with months and months of mental anguish,and sleepless nights.\u00a0 They defamed my character, when they reported the bonus promised to me as unpaid debt to all three credit bureaus, and dropped my otherwise near perfect credit score almost 150 points, making it impossible to get any loans for business I'm working on. The very entity that did not have the proper oversight to follow the proper procedures to get the contracts right in the first place, now lacks the proper oversight to follow the proper procedures in their collection activities, and are dodging legal due process as a result.</p>\n<p>My argument is this. If they feel the contracts were not valid 10 years after the fact, they need to either file criminal charges against those who they feel may have committed illegally activity, or they need to file civil charges against those who they feel were not eligible for the bonuses.\u00a0 The CA Army National Guard and Defense Finance and Accounting Service are\u00a0each just\u00a0one of thousands of government and state agencies, they are in no way the supreme governmental authority, and lack the legal jurisdiction to act as a judge in any legal dispute, let alone one that they are party to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yet they are completely skirting legal due process. Like any other entity, when it comes contract law, should they decide to dispute the contract after it's been completed, the burden to seek a decision by an independent court or other tribunal falls upon them, and without a judgment from said court or tribunal, they have no legal authority to garnish wages, or conduct any other collection activities. This is not an unpaid dept. This is money that was promised as part of a contractual agreement, which I, and many other soldiers like me honorably fulfilled with blood, sweat, and tears.</p>\n<p>We pride ourselves with honor in the military. There is a term called honoring a contract, because it's not only the legal thing to do, but because it's an honorable thing to do. In regard to minor dependencies they found years after the contracts were completed during an audit, the CA Army National Guard should honor contracts soldiers signed in good faith and honorably completed. If they choose to be dishonorable and not honor them, they must be made to seek a judgment from a non partisan court or tribunal and immediately cease their illegal collection activities until a judgment is made in their favor. We are just soldiers, who did nothing wrong.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We did what we promised to do, and we are being punished for it.\u00a0 The National Guard Bureau, and Defense Finance and Accounting,\u00a0conned us in, and are now actually profiteering from their misrepresentation, and lack of oversight.\u00a0\u00a0This is despicable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you support the ones who sacrificed so much, please stand with us sign this petition and pass it on.\u00a0 We really need America's support.\u00a0 Thank you. Soldiers.\u00a0 If you received a bonus recoup letter also, please email me at robert_richmond@yahoo.com.\u00a0 I want to make sure you are represented.

A class action lawsuit has been filed by a lawyer and friend of one of the soldiers in the recoup.  I couldn't find a lawyer willing to take on the National Guard and Defense Finance Accounting Service in CA.  God knows I tried.  The Lawyer, Daniel Willman, lives in Michigan, and has been spending his own dime to fly to CA to hand this.  We are not suing for damages and court costs so we have to come up with the funds on our own.  Mr. Willman says if every soldier in the class action pays $15 or so, that would be enough to help fund this.  I frankly think every soldier in the military has already wrote the ultimate check when they signed the dotted line, and shouldn't have to pay anything.  That's why I'm so mad.  The burden should have been on the CA National Guard, not the soldier who did nothing wrong.  So please don't feel obligated, and please don't make any large donations.  For those of you who are in a financial position to do so, a simple $5.00 donation would go a long way.  Those troops who have already sacrificed so much would surely appreciate it.  Not everyone is in a good financial position these days, and a lot of people are not comfortable making payments online.  No worries, just please share our petition.  Thanks again everyone, I personally appreciate each and everyone of you.  I have made it priority to read everyone of your comments and will continue to do so until too many people join in. \n\nhttps://www.youcaring.com/military-personnel-s-court-costs-and-legal-fees-529281#.VtE_rtePnsI.facebook",

Per the Army's instructions, I filled out paperwork to dispute their actions, and they stated they are too overwhelmed to get to it, so it will take 12 months before they will get around to reviewing the paperwork.  They don't have enough manpower?  They are pretending to have a remedy for soldiers who signed contracts in good faith, but it will take a year to wait for their decision.  They have enough personnel to add penalties and send out collection letters each month.  It only took them 30 days to send letters to all three collection agencies ruining my perfect credit which ruined a project I was working on, making it difficult to earn money to take care of my family, and it only took them a little over 90 days to send my collection to the Treasury department.  The minimum time they are required to wait before turning a debt over to them.  They have enough time and manpower to ruin soldiers lives who did nothing wrong, but not enough time process these alleged remedies they have provided for soldiers.  Thank you everybody for your support, but please, please share this petition with everyone you know. This is not right. 17,000 Soldiers who laid their lives on the line for their country shouldn't be victims of government abuse.  I remember my first week in Iraq, we came under enemy mortar fire that resulted in 6 casualties.  There were so many holes in each casualty, that half of our team had to plug them with their fingers while 2 medics frantically treated the casualties one at a time while the other half of the team returned fire.  That's what we did to honor our end of the contracts.  We were a little short on manpower and we got the job done in an hour.  They have about half a million soldiers stateside and nobody shooting at them and they can't review our cases, but they have time to screw our lives up after all we gave.

A class action law suit was started some time ago.  The Army has attempted to squash the law suit, by telling the primary named soldier on the class action suit, that his case is unique, and they will forgive him of his debt, but there is no need for a class action suit because the Army has offered a remedy for soldiers who signed contracts in good faith.  We all know that remedy is not fair, takes years to go through in some cases, and they have ruined our lives, credit, and have been their own judge in jury.  So you guys need to write letters for the lawyer to present on Oct. 20th.  Please read instructions below.\n\nPlease convert all letters into PDF Form.\n\n \n\nThank You\n\nS/Daniel C. Willman\n\n \n\n\nIn a message dated 9/25/2016 12:10:49 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time, strother_bryan@yahoo.com writes:\n\n\n\nAll,   (please forward to interested/ involved parties)\n\n \n\n  On Oct 20th Attorney Willman will be here in Sac responding to the DOD attorney's attempt to quash this \"our\" class action suit.  As I have advised \"DOD\" is trying to make this suit go away quietly.  DODs main focus to Quash the case is that there are \"clear available remedies\" for those affected and that my case is unique.  My case is not unique! Ten years of Appeals (legal foot dragging) in my case is not a \"clear available remedy!\" Willman now needs to prove this with at least a half dozen individuals to come forward and write a short letter in how this has affected you, you family, your career etc.  See my letter attached as example. It also needs to be notarized.  This brings letters to a higher level of credibility in the courtroom. Your letter will also become a focal point in  the case, and dissolve DODs \"make them go away\" scheme.  I notarized mine at the UPS store, or bank, I wrote my letter on open office you can down load free. You will need to sign your letter in front of the notary.  Willman needs these letters no later than one week to have them submitted for the 20 Oct hearing. Scan your letter with notary service attached and forward to Attorney Willman : danielCwillman@aol.com                   Sincerely, B. Strother",

They have sacrificed over and over again, yet they are one of the most incredibly neglected and overlooked group of citizens in this nation. The fact that our freedom has ridden on the backs of these men and women, who were brave enough to stand in place for every one of us who have fearfully rejected being exposed to such devastating circumstances, need to be supported and taken care of. I am disappointed, disgusted, and ashamed to hear that the only \"answer\" that could be conjured up is to subject judgment and punishment upon many for the deplorable decisions of a few. The men and women of our United States military should not have to pay for the mistakes of others, especially after they agreed to risk their lives in hellish situations for extended tours of duty and were promised this additional compensation as a means to offset their incredibly selfless decision to fight for and on behalf of each and every one of us. Don't pass this opportunity to do what's right and risk tarnishing the good names of these people and our country. Creating terrible perceptions of our military will not only have lasting effects on those who currently serve, but will also create a devastating precedent that will only help to deter every person who would consider joining this elite group of warriors. I implore that this situation be reexamine and the fulfillment and restoration of this situation be revealed in favor of these who's trust has clearly been disaffirmed. ",

Then you receive letters in the mail from state governors thanking you for your service completion. Then you get a letter telling you, \"YOU OWE US OUR MONEY BACK WITH INTEREST. PAY US OR WE'LL TAKE IT BY ANY MEANS\" When someone at the top of the chain doesn't take accountability for their own actions, this is the end result. Obviously this isn't fair for all who have completed their contract. Plus Mr. Richmond is an honest man, served his his country in very good faith. Now he deserves to be happy.

They did the same thing to that soldiers wife also. So they were making no money (he had to stay at home to care for the kids while she was taking her turn on a deployment. You hit the nail on the head with this Rob. I was one of the few fortunate ones who had my 10 year old documentation clearly indicating the reason for my bonuses as well as a copy of the regulations that justified them. When I pressed the poor specialist who answered my 3rd phone call (worst detail ever) as to the legality of this process I asked him some of the same questions that you pointed out, Rob. I also asked them that since the bonus portion of the contract was not valid, then the entire contract was not valid (basic four corners doctrine of contract law) if they would be letting people out early without penalty. Of course the answer was no. This is truly a travesty. The vast vast majority of us served with honor and upheld all of the army values, day in and day out. We ignored our needs, our families needs and our friends opinions. We answered our nation's call to service because our nation needed our help, and this is the Thank you we receive. If these soldiers have to pay back bonuses that were impossible to verify the legitimacy of, it would be an unfathomable miscarriage of justice. Surely I cannot give them back the nightmares, changed personality, or insomnia, nor would I want to quite honestly. My scars remind my of my service and provide me with perspective. It is such a shame that the California Army National Guard could not leave bad enough alone. ",

I'm very easy to find online, but instead of Googling my name, the guard determined that because the paperwork was missing this was a debt to be collected. I've been out of the guard since 2007 and now, in Nov. 2015, I get a threat from the Treasury that they're going to garnish my wages! This issue is so much bigger than me.

The Soldiers were (and still are, unfortunately) being punished for something they had no control over. and then, multiple years later (some contracts as far back as 2001), they find themselves with a debt. \n\nWhat SHOULD have happened is that all of the contracts during that time period AND all personnel responsible for executing contracts in any way (from recruiting to readiness NCO's) should have been investigated for fraud. Any contract that is not found to be willfully fraudulent at the fault of the soldier should have been granted a blanket Exception to Policy. \n\nAlso, there is a Statute of Limitations that requires that all obligated payments must be paid within 6 Fiscal Years (the FY of the payment due date + 5), or the payment expires and cannot be paid. For example, if a payment is due in January 2011, it MUST be paid BEFORE then end of FY 2016, or it expires.

In my opinion, the government needs to assume the total cost of this matter and should leave the veterans alone.

    "overview": "<p>It\u2019s been over 23 years since I spent Thanksgiving with my mom. This year was no different. For most of my life, my mother has been behind bars, serving a life without parole sentence for a nonviolent drug offense.</p>\n<p>My mom\u2019s name is Cheryl Howard and I am her only child; she has 3 grand children (2 girls ages 14 and 7 and 1 boy age 13). We have always had a close relationship. One of my last memories together was Halloween when I was the Cowardly Lion from The Wiz. My mother worked so hard on my costume and I was embarrassed by my curls I had as the lion but I remember everyone telling us how great my costume was.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was one of the only childhood moments we had together. Then my mom started abusing drugs like cocaine. It changed everything. Soon she was arrested and in 1995 convicted of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, and one count of conspiracy. <strong>She was given a life sentence without the possibility of parole.</strong></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t want to make excuses for my mom -- she made mistakes. But I also believe that with help for her addiction she could have gotten better. Instead she was sent to prison for the rest of her life and without clemency from President Obama, she will die there. President Obama has now granted clemency to over 1,000 nonviolent drug offenders like my mom. But only 68 have been women and time is running it out. My mother has accepted full responsibility for actions and has suffered enough. I'm begging President Obama to grant her clemency. \u00a0</p>\n<p>While in prison she obtained her GED, completed Vocational Training and Tarrant Community College courses, (2) Pierpont College courses and creative writing courses. She has maintained employment through the Life Connections Program (LCP) which helps inmates learn life skills so that upon release she can be successful and equipped with job skills. After release she want to start a program called \u201cFed Up,\u201d which stands for Federal Ex-offender\u2019s Driven to their Unexpected, to help female ex-offenders with life coaching, counseling, and job placement.</p>\n<p>I hear the pain in her voice when she says how remorseful she is for the crimes she committed. Her voice has kept me on the right path in raising my own family. She is truly a changed person, prepared to contribute to her community and society if released. In January 2015 she had 3 aneurysms rupture and was placed on life support for 31 days. She has recovered but I worry everyday.</p>\n<p>That Cowardly Lion Halloween costume is symbolic because I\u2019ve carried courage with me my entire life. For 23 years I\u2019ve missed every precious moment most people have with their mothers. I can only guess what they feel like. I have three children she has never held as babies. I\u2019ve even delayed my wedding in the hopes that she will be able to walk me down the aisle with my Aunt.</p>\n<p><strong>Please sign my petition to ask President Obama to grant clemency to a mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend who deserves a second chance.</strong></p>\n<p><em>For more information regarding my mother's case and others whom deserve Justice through clemency please visit <a href=\"http://www.candoclemency.com/cheryl-howard\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.candoclemency.com/cheryl-howard</a> <a href=\"http://www.candoclemency.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.candoclemency.com/</a></em></p>",

Here is my email. \n<a href=\"mailto:kappiepage@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">kappiepage@gmail.com</a>\nI will be praying as hard as I can for your mother and your family.",

If money were spent on community-based rehab programs instead of backing an absurdly overcrowded prison system, people like Ms. Howard could actually benefit others. Free drug rehab is ultimately far cheaper than prison, though, in a country where just about everything is about money, it's hardly a surprise that for-profit prisons prosper as they do. Drug addiction is not a criminal justice issue. It is a mental health issue. Think about why people turn to drugs in the first place-- crime-infested neighborhoods where it's not safe to play outside, crap schools, no job prospects, limited healthcare, families buckling under financial strain, etc. Is it any wonder people start using? This country needs a major overhaul. When people support each other, offer hope and a helping hand, a lot can change, people and their circumstances can improve. Ms. Howard has already spent more than two decades behind bars. She has more than demonstrated that, even under very harsh conditions, people can be and do better. Please give her a chance to be reunited with her daughter and live her life.     ",

    "overview": "<p>I am one of a group of Native American activists and allies who have been protesting an oil pipeline that is set to cross the Missouri River a mile away from the Standing Rock reservation, and threatens to poison our water. For months, we have been peacefully working to stop construction on what we see as a threat to the safety of all people, yet we have been met with only violence and mistreatment by law enforcement for doing what we believe is right.</p>\n<p>The county sheriff is not doing his job, which is to protect all people in Morton County. <strong>Sign my petition asking Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem to conduct an ethics investigation into Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier and remove him from office.</strong></p>\n<p>Under his leadership, Morton County police have failed to protect peaceful North Dakotans from vicious dog attacks, unleashed by a private security company. Sheriff Kirchmeier has displayed bias on Facebook and in media interviews, and has withheld information from North Dakotan residents in order to further the agenda of the Dakota Access LLC.</p>\n<p>In addition, activists are being constantly surveilled and questioned, then met with road blocks as they try to reach the camps. The sheriff\u2019s office has regularly accused us of harassing ranchers and farmers in spite of our peaceful actions, and charges brought against nonviolent water protectors have increased. Even Amy Goodman, a renowned journalist who was present at an action, has had a warrant issued for her arrest \u2013\u00a0a clear violation of freedom of the press. The Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department response to our peaceful protests has been so severe that the ACLU is investigating whether they have violated the constitution.</p>\n<p><strong>Please join me in asking for the immediate removal of Sheriff Kirchmeier.</strong></p>\n<p>As citizens of this country we have the right to participate in peaceful protest without being met by a militarized and biased police force more interested in protecting corporate interests than the people of North Dakota.</p>",
